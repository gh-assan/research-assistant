        Extract key concepts from the following
        Topic: %<topic>s
        text: %<text>s
        -----------------------------------------
        Then, take a second passâ€”go beyond the obvious. Identify deeper, underlying themes,
        hidden connections, and abstract principles that might not be immediately apparent.
        Consider alternative perspectives, interdisciplinary insights, and conceptual frameworks that could enrich the
        understanding of this topic. Push the boundaries of interpretation and generate novel or speculative ideas that
        could lead to new research directions.

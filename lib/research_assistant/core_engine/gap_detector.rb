            ----------------------------------------
            First, pinpoint missing data, weak arguments, or assumptions that need more evidence. Then, take a second passâ€”go beyond the surface. Think critically and creatively:
            What unconventional angles or interdisciplinary insights might reveal deeper gaps?
            Are there emerging trends, alternative theories, or speculative ideas that challenge the current understanding?
            What questions remain unanswered, and how could they inspire new research directions?
            Push the boundaries of conventional analysis to uncover gaps that others might miss."

                "insight": "A concise summary of the missing or incomplete concept in the analysis.",
                "classification": "The category of the gap within the analysis. Possible values: foundational, critical, counterfactual, synthesis.",
                "significance": "A brief explanation of why addressing this gap is important for improving the analysis."

        Analyze the following response and identify gaps in knowledge, overlooked perspectives, and areas needing further exploration.
        Response: %<response>s
        Analysis: %<analysis>s
        ----------------------------------------
        First, pinpoint missing data, weak arguments, or assumptions that need more evidence. Then, take a second passâ€”go beyond the surface. Think critically and creatively:
        What unconventional angles or interdisciplinary insights might reveal deeper gaps?
        Are there emerging trends, alternative theories, or speculative ideas that challenge the current understanding?
        What questions remain unanswered, and how could they inspire new research directions?
        Push the boundaries of conventional analysis to uncover gaps that others might miss.

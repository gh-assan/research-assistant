        Carefully analyze the following text and extract key insights across different dimensions.
        Topic: %<topic>s
        Text: %<text>s
        ----------------------------------------
        First, identify the most critical takeaways, patterns, and underlying themes. Then, take a second passâ€”go beyond the surface. Generate deeper insights by:
        Identifying hidden connections: What underlying principles, implicit assumptions, or indirect influences are at play?
        Challenging conventional interpretations: How might this text be understood differently through alternative lenses or disciplines?
        Considering future implications: What long-term consequences, speculative ideas, or unanswered questions emerge from this analysis?
        Exploring paradoxes or tensions: Are there contradictions, gaps, or areas where conventional wisdom may be flawed?
        Push the boundaries of interpretation to reveal insights that are not immediately obvious, enriching the depth and originality of the analysis.

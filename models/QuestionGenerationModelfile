Your task is to **analyze the given text and generate a diverse set of thought-provoking questions** to challenge and expand its ideas. These questions should be structured across multiple categories, progressively increasing in depth and complexity. Push beyond conventional inquiry to uncover **hidden assumptions, alternative viewpoints, and speculative possibilities**.

## **🔍 PHASE 1: Core Question Generation** – Establish a Strong Foundation
Generate multiple questions across the following categories:

1️⃣ **Foundational Questions** → Probe the fundamental principles, definitions, and assumptions.
   - What are the core ideas, and how are they defined?
   - What **underlying assumptions** shape the argument?
   - Are any **key concepts vague or ambiguous**?
   - How does this align with or contradict **existing theories**?

2️⃣ **Critical Questions** → Challenge the strengths, weaknesses, and biases of the argument.
   - What are the **strongest and weakest** aspects of the text?
   - Are there **logical flaws, inconsistencies, or gaps** in reasoning?
   - How might **bias, cultural context, or disciplinary perspective** influence the conclusions?
   - What are the **ethical, philosophical, or societal implications**?

3️⃣ **Counterfactual Questions** → Explore alternative scenarios and hypothetical changes.
   - How would the conclusions shift if **key variables changed**?
   - What if the **opposite argument** were true?
   - How would different **historical, technological, or environmental factors** impact the outcome?
   - What insights emerge from considering **unlikely or extreme scenarios**?

4️⃣ **Synthesis Questions** → Combine ideas to generate **new insights, theories, or applications**.
   - How do different concepts **interact or conflict** within the text?
   - What unexpected **connections** can be drawn between ideas?
   - How can these ideas be **applied in new or interdisciplinary contexts**?
   - What novel research directions or real-world solutions emerge?

## **🌊 PHASE 2: Push the Boundaries** – Deepen & Expand the Inquiry
Now, take a second pass over the generated questions and **enhance them further**:

🔹 **Deepen Foundational Questions** → Identify **unstated premises, conceptual blind spots, and implicit frameworks**.
🔹 **Strengthen Critical Questions** → Challenge the text from **multiple disciplines (philosophy, neuroscience, ethics, AI, etc.)**.
🔹 **Expand Counterfactual Questions** → Consider **improbable, extreme, or futuristic what-if scenarios**.
🔹 **Elevate Synthesis Questions** → Generate **novel, interdisciplinary insights that drive research forward**.

### **Strict Output Guidelines**
✅ **Organize questions by category** → Maintain clear sectioning for structured analysis.
✅ **Do not ask questions about the process** → Work **solely with the provided text**.
✅ **Always return responses in Markdown format** → Ensure readability and clarity.
✅ **Provide only the questions** → No meta-commentary or explanations.
